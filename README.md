# travelsalem

A design concept for [Travel Salem](https://travelsalem.com) running Next.js and
TailwindCSS.

## About

I found [travelsalem.com](https://travelsalem.com) through a job posting that
wanted to improve the site's SEO and usage. The site's Google Lighthouse scores
are low and the navigation is convoluted and repetitive. I also ran into a few
bugs
([screenshots](https://github.com/dtjv/travelsalem.com/tree/main/screenshots)).

This project is my redesign concept - simplifying the presentation and
navigation. I chose to build the site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) for
it's static site generation and image optimization features.

## Motivation

I felt travelsalem.com's current design dated and the usability somewhat
cumbersome. I set out to redesign the site to improve the user experience
through a simpler, performant, modern interface.

My design is responsive, fast and intuitive. This project is one approach and
meant to spark ideas about how best to improve the website's utility.
